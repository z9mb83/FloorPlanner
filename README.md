# INDUS  
### Intelligent Native Design & Urban Structuring System

INDUS is a Prompt-Based AI Architectural Planning System that generates optimized residential floor plans using natural language instructions combined with structured spatial intelligence.

Users can describe what they want — and INDUS converts those prompts into intelligent, regulation-aware, culturally aligned layouts.

---

## 🌟 What Makes INDUS Different?

Unlike traditional floor planning tools that rely only on fixed inputs, INDUS understands **natural language prompts** such as:

- "I want a bigger lawn."
- "Make the living room more spacious."
- "Kitchen should face east."
- "Master bedroom must have attached balcony."
- "More privacy for guest room."
- "Keep car parking separate from lawn."

The system interprets these preferences and converts them into structured architectural logic.

## 🧠 Core Concept

INDUS combines:

1. Prompt Interpretation Engine  
2. Constraint-Based Planning  
3. Graph-Based Room Adjacency  
4. Spatial Optimization Algorithms  
5. Vastu & Directional Intelligence  

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Prompt-Based Layout Customization

Users describe preferences in natural language.

The system extracts:
- Spatial priorities
- Size adjustments
- Directional constraints
- Privacy requirements
- Adjacency changes

Example:

Input:
"I want a bigger lawn and smaller parking. Keep kitchen in southeast and living room near entrance."

System converts this into:
- Increase lawn area weight
- Reduce parking allocation
- Kitchen → Southeast constraint
- Living room → Entrance adjacency rule

---

### 2. AI Floor Plan Generator

- Generates multiple optimized layouts.
- Prioritizes user prompts.
- Maintains structural feasibility.
- Balances aesthetics and function.

---

### 3. Constraint Engine

Handles:
- Plot dimensions
- Setbacks
- Road direction
- Floor count
- Local regulation logic

---

### 4. Graph-Based Room Adjacency Engine

Rooms are treated as nodes in a spatial graph.

Rules define:
- Required adjacency (Kitchen ↔ Dining)
- Restricted adjacency (Toilet ✕ Kitchen)
- Privacy zoning
- Public vs Private space separation

---

### 5. Optimization Engine

- Maximizes usable area
- Minimizes dead circulation space
- Balances prompt priorities
- Maintains structural practicality

---

### 6. Vastu-Aware Planning

Optional strictness levels:
- Soft preference
- Balanced
- Strict compliance

Directional room placement logic is integrated into the optimization process.

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- Individual homeowners
- First-time builders
- Architects needing rapid layout iteration
- Small developers
- Tier 2 & Tier 3 city plot owners

---

## 💡 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

- Prompt-driven architectural generation
- AI + Cultural design intelligence
- Instant multi-variation layout output
- Graph-based structured planning
- Affordable alternative to manual drafting

INDUS behaves like a **digital architect you can talk to.**
