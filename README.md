# INDUS  
### Intelligent Native Design & Urban Structuring System

INDUS is an AI-powered residential floor planning system that integrates modern architectural optimization with culturally intelligent design principles such as Vastu-based spatial logic.

The platform simplifies complex home planning by automatically generating optimized, regulation-aware, and functionally structured floor plans.
